# TCP-Chat
Creation of a messenger in python is performed using pyqt5 python and has a graphical interface. This project is implemented entirely in python using sockets, and the following modules: pyqt5, socket, rsa, and many others.  This python messenger is protected from timing and MITM attacks.  This project is fully implemented in Python using asymmetric RSA encryption and is built on the Socket module with the generation of authentication files. Each node connects ONLY using the key file of the other node, which is generated in advance and transmitted between the chat participants. The entire process of correspondence is not saved on the computer and will be cleared after the program ends, since it is stored only in RAM.  The server is used only for transferring data between the participants, while it is impossible to decrypt your messages on the server side. And yes, the server-client model is completely TCP-based.

Please note that TCP is produced independently from the Tor® anonymity software, I am not related with or sponsored by torproject.org. TCP-Chat is making use of the Tor® client software and the Windows version comes bundled with original Tor binaries but TCP-Chat itself is a completely separate project developed by totally different people, so if you instead want to buy the developers of Tor® from torproject.org a beer (they deserve it even more than me and without their great Tor software my little program would not have been possible) then please consider doing so at the following address:

# Tests
If you want to test new versions of TorChat, send me a simple e-mail to nordbearbot.

I will send you betas or golden master versions some days before official releases, and if you have free time and motivation, you can peacefully test them and tell me if you saw problematic stuff. It's a best effort testing, so no pressure.
